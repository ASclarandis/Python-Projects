#Python Projects
This repository contains all of the Python projects assigned to me from The Tech Academy.

**Game.py** This project created a game where the user can input if they would be nice or mean in given scenarios. The game keeps a score on how many times the user selects "nice" or "mean", then prints a message depending on their score. 

**Abstraction.py** This exercise uses an abstract class and abstract method to display a credit card statement. It shows what was paid during the month and what balance remains.

**Classes.py** This assignment shows class inheritance with one parents class and two child classes with their own unique attributes.

**Dbassignment.py** In this assignment I used sqlite3 to create a database with files from a file list. I implemented an if statement to only add files to the database that ended in .txt.

**Encapsulation.py** This assignment shows the use of encapsulation to create protected and private class, as well as objects that use the protected and private classes.

**File_Transer.py** In this project I created a tkinter GUI that transferred files from a file source into the file destination. I was tasked to write code that only transferred files that were created or modified within the last 24 hours. 

**Polymorphism.py** In this assignment I had to create a parent class with a function and two child classes that had their own unique attributes and their own ways of performing the parent class function. 

**Web_Page_Generator.py** In this project I created a tkinter GUI that allows a user to generate a basic web page. The use can either enter in a custom message to be displayed on the web page or they can use the default text in the app.
